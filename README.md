# Will Midgette Portfolio Website Repo

## Updating portfolio website from PHP to React.js
-  Uses styled-components api
-  CSS Grid and Flexbox for page layouts
-  react-router-dom to direct between pages
-  Integrate 3rd party API Swiper.js for project image carousel with naviation and clickable thumbnails
-  Project objects created in ProjectsArray.js rendered dynamically by Projects.js 
-  Emailjs api used for sending contact info. Because this is primarily a front-end application I decided to not create a node.js server only to send emails
